# Simon Color game

This is a browser game based on the color/pattern picking children's toy by the same name.

A color is chosen and a sound will play, you will have to repeat the increasingly difficult pattern as the levels go on.

Should you get the answer wrong, the game will play an alarming sound and you will be prompted to restart the game from level 1.
